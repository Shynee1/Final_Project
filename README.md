Want to test your drawing skills? See if my neural network can guess what you are drawing! \
This model has been trained on Google's [QuickDraw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) dataset to recognize hand-drawn doodles

It can recognize 15 different types of drawings:
- `Banana`
- `Bandage`
- `Book`
- `Cake`
- `Camera`
- `Cell Phone`
- `Face`
- `Hamburger` 
- `Pizza`
- `Sailboat` 
- `Sheep`
- `Star` 
- `Sword`
- `Television`
- `Effiel Tower`

This was made as my final project for Brown University's summer AI program.
